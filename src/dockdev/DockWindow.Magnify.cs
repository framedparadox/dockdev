/// Hover used to be left to each item <c>Button</c>'s own <c>PointerOver</c> state, the way the
/// gear still does it, and on a cell realized by the
/// <c>ItemsRepeater</c> that state never arrived — so a dock item had no hover cue at all, and the
/// only feedback the strip gave was the swell, which is opt-in. Driving the highlight from the
/// same tracking the swell uses makes it independent of that: whatever the repeater's cells do
/// with their own pointer events, this sees the moves on the strip and says which cell the cursor
/// is in.

/// above the strip would be a tall slab of glass with a strip of icons along the bottom of it.
